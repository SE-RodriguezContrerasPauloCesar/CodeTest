# CodeTest

WEB SERVICE CHALLENGE

Developed functions can be found in the following path "codetest/polls/views.py"

Questions:
1. What would you do differently if you had more time?
Learn a little more about IP address tracking and server management. I would try to show the related program information in a better way.

2. What is the runtime complexity of each function?
I would have to evaluate it at a higher level.

3. How does your code work?
The program should call a server or connect to a service to receive the requests and work with them. On the user side it should have options to perform the top100() and clear() actions.

4. What other approaches did you decide not to pursue?
The concept of Django applications, handling requests and servers through sockets or semaphores.

5. How would you test this?
By connecting to a server that allows me to work with the volume of inputs described in this challenge. Even getting the data through a REST API service.
